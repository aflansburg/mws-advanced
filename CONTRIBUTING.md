## Contributing

At this time, if there's a change you'd like to make, please make a pull request -- many functions
are not yet implemented, so if something will make your life better, it will probably make other
people's lives better.  If you're not comfortable with submitting a pull request, then please file
an Issue in the github Issue Tracker, and hopefully someone will at least discuss it, if not help
it happen.

# Code guidelines

The repository is configured to require that all changed code files pass eslint.  Please do not
override that.
If you don't like the eslint rules, then please file an Issue so we can discuss that.

Please add tests for your new code.  If you're not familiar with mocha/chai, it's a fantastic thing
to learn, and will help you find a lot of bugs in code.  I can't count the number of times that
newly written tests for old code have shown up with unexpected results.  If you're having trouble
with writing a test, please make a Pull request with the code that needs help, and we'll discuss it.

# Ultimately

Ultimately, I want this to be a fantastic library, and I use it myself, in my own projects. I share
it with the world, for many reasons, one of which is that I want to make it easier for people to
handle the MWS data, and another very important one is that I want your help.  So, anything that
blocks you from using this, or anything that can be improved on -- let's discuss it!  Or, if you're
comfortable with making changes, then go ahead and do so. :-)

# Lastly

Don't forget: Today -- BE AWESOME.
